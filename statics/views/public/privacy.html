    <p>
        Your privacy is critically important to us. At MetaMakerSpace we have a few fundamental principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
        </li>
        <li>
            We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

        MetaMakerSpace (“<strong>MetaMakerSpace</strong>”) operates <a href="http://www.MetaMakerSpace.com/">metamakerspace.com</a>. It is MetaMakerSpace's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
    </p>
    <h3>website visitors</h3>
    <p>
        Like most website operators, MetaMakerSpace collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MetaMakerSpace's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MetaMakerSpace's visitors use its website. From time to time, MetaMakerSpace may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
        MetaMakerSpace also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and visitors. MetaMakerSpace only discloses logged in user and visiter addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>
    <h3>gathering of personally-identifying information</h3>
    <p>
        Certain visitors to MetaMakerSpace's website choose to interact with MetaMakerSpace in ways that require MetaMakerSpace to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MetaMakerSpace gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with MetaMakerSpace – by purchasing extra features, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, MetaMakerSpace collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with MetaMakerSpace. MetaMakerSpace does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
    </p>
    <h3>aggregated statistics</h3>
    <p>
        MetaMakerSpace may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, MetaMakerSpace may monitor the most popular majig types. MetaMakerSpace may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MetaMakerSpace does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
    </p>
    <h3>protection of certain personally-identifying information</h3>
    <p>
        MetaMakerSpace discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MetaMakerSpace’s behalf or to provide services available at MetaMakerSpace’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MetaMakerSpace’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MetaMakerSpace will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MetaMakerSpace discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MetaMakerSpace believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MetaMakerSpace, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a MetaMakerSpace website and have supplied your email address, MetaMakerSpace may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MetaMakerSpace and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MetaMakerSpace takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
